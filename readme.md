Project 天 (pronounced Ti-en; defn. "Sky" in Mandarin) is a React Native app that maps out live temperature and weather data for ~500 historical sites and national parks across the United States in Google Maps. In the last couple years, I have become more in-tune with nature, going out hiking friends almost every week and trekking across almost every trail in Orange County, California. In the summer of 2020 while interviewing for a fullstack position at SpringGem Weather Information, I was tasked a coding challenge to create a React Native app that reported live temperature and weather data for several arbitrary geographical coordinates. Inspired by this challenge, I had the idea to apply the challenge’s concept of mapping out live weather data to United States National Parks. And that was how Project 天 was conceived.

As per the coding challenge’s specifications, Project 天's UI is coded with React-Native. Geographic coordinates for all 497 national parks were fetched through the National Parks Services’ REST API and marked on a Google Maps component generated through Google Maps Platform. By entering these coordinates into the OpenWeatherMap API, I was able to give each marker a popover displaying live temperature and weather statistics at that coordinate.

For me, Project 天 is another milestone project not only because it was my first mobile app and one that used many REST APIs, but also because it was one of my first projects that I had an original idea for and that I did for fun. Not to mention, I also speedran this project, finishing it in around a week’s time. When I first started attending university, I was clueless about software development and could at first only follow tutorials and coding exercises that I barely understood. It was a slow process, and oftentimes I would find myself banging my head against a wall. However, through persistence and many attempts, I would create my first legitimate side project, Colorful Calculator. Each side project after that was less daunting but were still learning experiences. Six months later, I surprise myself with how far my React development skills have grown with Project 天.
